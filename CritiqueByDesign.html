<p align = center>This critique is based on the following article by BBC titled "If young people stopped wasting their money on lavish things like toast, could they use that money to buy a house? We crunched the numbers to find out."

<h3 align = center>Explanation: </h3>
<p align = center>The article basiaclly tells the number of avocado toasts that a person has to give up in order to pay a deposit in house. 
  Different cities require different amounts (factors to consider include: average costs of house and average cost of an avo toast). </p>
  
  
  
<h3 align = center>Critique on above Data Visual: </h3>
<p align = center>
  <ol>
    <li>I really liked the colour scheme of the visualisation. It seems relevant and the mildness makes it appealing. </li></br>
    <li>Although the graphics are great (for example city logos, the avo-toasts) their overuse lead to distraction. I would make the numbers more attractive so the user doesn't have to look for the numerical information. </li></br>
    <li>The information redundancy is another drawback (2 sentences repeated 5 times). Also, a lot of information is provided which might confuse the reader.</li></br>
    <li>5 different graphs instead of one make comparison difficult.</li></br>
</ol></p>

<h3 align = center>My process: </h3>
<p align = center>
  <ol>
    <li>Initially, I thought of creating a geographic map of different cities, intensity depending on the number of avocado toast required. However, Tableau and other sources i knew did not recognise the sources. </li></br>
    <li>I made a simple bar chart of cities versus the number of avo toasts to reach deposit.</li></br>

    </br>

    <li>I showed my friends and got two feedback:
      <ul>
        <li>  Use the colors to emphasize the values</li>
        <li>Display the actual number</li></ul></li>
    </br>
    <li>I redid my designing. The following is the edited rough sketch.</li></br>

    </br>
    </br>
    <li>I created a final version on Tableau and came up with the following graph.</li></br>

<h3 align = center>Summary: </h3>
<p align = center>I have reduced the information clutter and redundancy so as to create a simple and informative graph. </br>
  Even though the visuals were aesthetically appealing and overcomplicated visuals may require a lot more effort to been put in,they make visuals hard to infer from. </br>
I believe the goal is to not to display the amount of effort and time invested in data visualizations but about how much value can be derived from it. </p>
