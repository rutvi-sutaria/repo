Data Visualisation Experiments:

I am going to post my assignments and project here as I continue on my journey to explore more about how to tell stories with data! I am interested to know more about this topic for two reasons: 
1. To explore different visual tools available and how to make most of them
2. To learn how to present complex information in a simple and engaging manner. This is an essential skill for an Analyst. 

Thank you!
