## Final presentation topic: 
# Coffee Consumption in USA

## Interest:
One of the fascinating things I noticed about USA is its consumption of coffee. It seems to be an essential part of the American culture. 
I have been interested to know more for quite some time and therefore I decided to research on the "Coffee Consumption in USA" for my final assignment.

## Medium used: 
Shorthand. Please find attached a rough outline on the shorthand site listed above along with a few initial sketches. I found few cool pictures from online websites for images and have added them to the website for storage for now.

## Method: 
I thought of a rough outline for my story as follows: 
1. A general introduction regarding coffee; its origin in general, the entire lifecycle from planting to brewing and types of coffee.
2. USA specific facts (how it came to USA, weird facts, annual revenue generate, price of coffee in USA compared to other countries, etc.)
3. A conclusion (why is coffee so popular?, general health benefits and a comparison with other beverages).

## Data Source:

The link below contains 4 datasets generated from publicly available websites. I have included a very brief description and data source as well. One datasets contain total revenue generated by coffee in US market in past and predictions for future. Another contains price of a cup of coffee around the world so as to provide a global comparision. It also provides insights into how much and where Americans prefer to drink their coffee.

## Next Steps:

1. Finalize the topics that I will include (add relevant and/ or drop insignificant parts) for making a cohesive story. 
2. Get more details from online sources and start working on a rough draft for story. Create neat visualizations for supporting the narrative.  
3. Choose a more appealing color scheme and modify using images.
4. Get feedback from friends.
