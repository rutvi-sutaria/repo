## Final presentation topic: 
# Coffee Consumption in USA


## PART 1:

## Interest:
One of the fascinating things I noticed about USA is its consumption of coffee. It seems to be an essential part of the American culture. 
I have been interested to know more for quite some time and therefore I decided to research on the "Coffee Consumption in USA" for my final assignment.

## Medium used: 
Shorthand. Please find attached a rough outline on the shorthand site listed above along with a few initial sketches. I found few cool pictures from online websites for images and have added them to the website for storage for now.

## Method: 
I thought of a rough outline for my story as follows: 
1. A general introduction regarding coffee; its origin in general, the entire lifecycle from planting to brewing and types of coffee that are popular today. 
2. USA specific facts (how it came to USA, weird facts, annual revenue generate, price of coffee in USA compared to other countries, etc.)
3. A conclusion (why is coffee so popular?, general health benefits and a comparison with other beverages). 
4. Call to action: What amount of coffee consumption is healthy? Is there a suitable time for consumption?

## Data Source:

The link below contains 4 datasets generated from publicly available websites. I have included a very brief description and data source as well. One datasets contain total revenue generated by coffee in US market in past and predictions for future. Another contains price of a cup of coffee around the world so as to provide a global comparision. It also provides insights into how much and where Americans prefer to drink their coffee.

## Next Steps:

Analyse what are the most relevant topics for the story-telling based on impact they create. Get feedback from friends for this. Finalize the topics to be included based on the feedback and consequently add relevant and/ or drop insignificant parts for making a cohesive story. 

Get more details from online sources and start working on a rough draft for story. Find information for the introductary portion which includes origin of coffee, countries currently growing coffee and the entire lifecycle of coffee. Also include the different types of coffee and categorise based on caffiene content.

Create neat visualizations for supporting the narrative. Try to come up with different forms of visualization rather than bar graphs for most. Get embedded codes for all and include that.  Choose a more appealing color scheme and modify using images. Finally, get feedback from friends on the overall story and modify accordingly.


## PART 2:

## Restructuring different sections

I modified the initial draft by changing history of coffee to history of coffee in USA specifically. I divided the entire article into four section:

Section 1: History of Coffee in USA (Mostly textual, with an appropriate backgroud image or color).

Section 2: This is subdivided into  two categories: 
  1. Coffee Facts: The coffee Lifecycle and different types of coffee based on caffeine content.
  2. USA Coffee Facts: Revenue Generated from 2010 to predictions till 2023, where people usually drink coffee and the number   of cups of coffee consumed per day by an individual.
  3. Coffee prices around the world for one cup (in USD.)
  
 Section 3: What amount of coffee is good for you?
  1. Number of coffee cups per day chart showing the amount of healthy vs. unhealthy consumption. 
  2. Health benefits gained when consuming coffee in the right amount. 
  3. Health hazards of overconsumption of coffee.

## Identifying the audience and conducting interviews

I identified people who dring coffee daily as my target audience. Since a lot of people fall into this category, it was easy to get interviews. Below are the questions for the interview and the responses I received:

### 1. Information about the interviewee:
